# pose-estimation-kitti
3D reconstruction and Visual Odometry 


This project consists of 3 main parts : 
1. **Transformation and projection of a cloud of Lidar points on a camera (3D to 2D)** : In this part you will use the transformations provided by the dataset to project a
3D point cloud (Lidar/Velodyne source) onto the image plane of the first color camera (left). This allows you to know the depth of a set of 2d points in the image, but also 
to know the color of the 3D points.
